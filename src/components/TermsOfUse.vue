          with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and

          We hold the right to disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements in certain cases, including but not limited
          to: to enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or
          to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy and applicable laws and regulations. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third
          parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. Sellsuki operates under the Privacy Policies
          of Facebook.com that is explained by the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          “Facebook Platform lets you log into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log in using Facebook,
          we give the site your User ID (just like when you connect with any other application), but we do not share your
          email address with that website through this process without your permission and no password is retrieved from
          your Facebook account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you already have an account on that website, the site may also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account.
          Sometimes it does this using what is called an "email hash", which is similar to searching for someone on Facebook
          using an email address. Only the email addresses in this case are hashed so no email addresses are actually shared
          between Facebook and the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website sends over a hashed version of your email address, and we match it with a database of email addresses that we
          have also hashed. If there is a match, then we tell the website the User ID associated with the email address.
          This way, when you log into the website using Facebook, the website can link your Facebook account to your account
          on that website.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, Facebook.com does not provide users passwords and no personal information can be retrieved without
          explicit approval by the user. Sellsuki also has no right to request such information from Facebook without users'
          authorization.
        </p>
